            <h3>Mac and Cheese</h3>
            <p><b>A cheesy and creamy classic favorite.</b</p>
            <p1>4 c. dried macaroni
                1 egg
                1/4 c. salted butter
                1/4 c. all-purpose flour
                2 1/2 c. whole milk
                2 heaping tsp. dry mustard, plus more to taste
                1 lb. cheese (such as cheddar, jack, and/or fontina), grated
                1/2 tsp. kosher salt, more to taste
                1/2 tsp. seasoned salt, plus more to taste
                1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
                Cayenne pepper, paprika, and/or thyme (optional)1
                Cook the macaroni until very firm.The macaroni should be too firm to eat right out of the pot. Beat the egg in a small bowl. Melt the butter in a large pot and sprinkle in the flour.
                 Whisk together over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture for 5 minutes, whisking constantly. Don't let it burn. Pour in the milk, add the mustard, and whisk until smooth. Cook for 5 minutes until very thick. Reduce the heat to low.Take 1/4 cup of the sauce and slowly pour it into the beaten egg, whisking constantly to avoid cooking the egg. Whisk together till smooth. Pour the egg mixture into the sauce, whisking constantly. Stir until smooth. 
                Add in the cheese and stir to melt. Add the salt, seasoned salt, pepper, and other optional seasonings.Taste the sauce, adding more salt and seasoned salt as needed. (Do not under-salt!)  Pour in the drained, cooked macaroni and stir to combine. Pour into a buttered baking dish, top with extra cheese, and bake at 350°F for 20 to 25 minutes, then serve.</p1>

            <h3>Chicken Wraps</h3>
            <p><b>Healthy and tasty chicken wraps for lunch.</b></p>
            <p1>Sauce:

                ½ cup mayonnaise
                
                ¼ cup finely chopped seedless cucumber
                
                1 tablespoon honey
                
                ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
                
                ground black pepper to taste
                
                Wraps:
                
                2 tablespoons olive oil
                
                1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into thin strips
                
                1 cup thick and chunky salsa
                
                1 tablespoon honey
                
                ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper
                
                8 (10 inch) flour tortillas
                
                1 (10 ounce) bag baby spinach leaves
                Make the sauce: Mix mayonnaise, cucumber, honey, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. 
                Cover and refrigerate until needed.

                Make the wraps: Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high heat. 
                Add chicken strips; cook and stir until they start to turn golden and are no longer pink in the middle, about 8 minutes. 
                Stir in salsa, honey, and cayenne pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.
                
                Stack tortillas, 4 at a time, in a microwave oven and heat until warm and pliable, 20 to 30 seconds per batch.
                
                Spread each tortilla with 1 tablespoon mayonnaise-cucumber sauce, top with a layer of spinach, and arrange about 1/2 cup of the chicken mixture on top.
                
                Fold the bottom of each tortilla up about 2 inches, and start rolling from the right side. When wrap is halfway rolled, fold the top of the tortilla down, enclosing the filling, and continue rolling to make a tight, compact cylinder.</p1>

            <h3>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3>
            <p><b>Sweet, chewy cookies with a chocolate surprise!</b></p>
            <p1>8 tablespoons of salted butter
                1/2 cup white sugar (I like to use raw cane sugar with a coarser texture)
                1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
                1 teaspoon vanilla
                1 egg
                1 1/2 cups all purpose flour (6.75 ounces)
                1/2 teaspoon baking soda
                1/4 teaspoon salt (but I always add a little extra)
                3/4 cup chocolate chips (I use a combination of chocolate chips and chocolate chunks)
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds to just barely melt it. It shouldn’t be hot – but it should be almost entirely in liquid form.Using a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the butter with the sugars until creamy. Add the vanilla and the egg; beat on low speed until just incorporated – 10-15 seconds or so (if you beat the egg for too long, the cookies will be stiff).
                Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until crumbles form. Use your hands to press the crumbles together into a dough. 
                It should form one large ball that is easy to handle (right at the stage between “wet” dough and “dry” dough). 
                Add the chocolate chips and incorporate with your hands.Roll the dough into 12 large balls (or 9 for HUGELY awesome cookies) and place on a cookie sheet. 
                Bake for 9-11 minutes until the cookies look puffy and dry and just barely golden. Warning, friends: DO NOT OVERBAKE. 
                This advice is probably written on every cookie recipe everywhere, but this is essential for keeping the cookies soft. 
                Take them out even if they look like they’re not done yet (see picture in the post). They’ll be pale and puffy.Let them cool on the pan for a good 30 minutes or so (I mean, okay, eat four or five but then let the rest of them cool).
                 They will sink down and turn into these dense, buttery, soft cookies that are the best in all the land. These should stay soft for many days if kept in an airtight container. I also like to freeze them.

            <h3>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h3>
            <p><b>Classic grilled cheese sandwich with golden toast.</b></p>
            <p1>2 slices sourdough bread , sliced 1.3–1.5cm thick (0.5 – 0.6″) – Note 1
                ▢30g/ 2 tbsp SALTED butter , for spreading on bread (or unsalted + pinch of salt)
                ▢1/3 cup (heaped) vintage cheddar cheese or gruyere, freshly grated (or other melting cheese of choice) – Note 2
                ▢30g/ 1/3 cup mozzarella, freshly grated – Note 2
                Butter bread – Slather both sides of each piece of bread with the butter (yes, all 4 sides!).
                Light toast – Heat a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over medium low heat (no oil or butter). Place both pieces of bread in the skillet and lightly toast for 1 minute to warm it through and create a light crust. (When we flip, this gives the cheese a head start).
                Pile on cheese – Flip one slice of bread, then pile on the cheddar cheese followed by the mozzarella. Place the other slice of bread on top, with the hot toasted side in contact with the cheese.
                Cook 3 minutes – Cook for 3 minutes or until the bread is evenly golden and crisp, pressing down lightly with a spatula every now and then. If it's browning too quickly, remove remove from the stove to cool down a bit and lower heat.
                Flip, 3 minutes – Turn the sandwich over, and cook the other side for 3 minutes or until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.
                Devour – Transfer to cutting board. Cut in half in one swift motion. Admire cheese pull. Devour.</p1>

            <h3>Spaghetti Bolognese</h3>
            <p><b>A rich and hearty meat sauce over pasta.</b></p>
            <p1>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
                ▢2 garlic cloves , minced
                ▢1 onion , finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)
                ▢1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef (Note 1)
                ▢1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine (sub water or beef broth/stock)
                ▢2 beef bouillon cubes , crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon (Note 2)
                ▢800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)
                ▢2 tbsp tomato paste
                ▢2 tsp white sugar , if needed (Note 3)
                ▢2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
                ▢2 dried bay leaves
                ▢2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)
                ▢3/4 tsp cooking salt (kosher salt)
                ▢1/2 tsp black pepper
                To Serve
                ▢400 g / 13 oz spaghetti , dried
                ▢Parmesan cheese and finely chopped parsley (optional)
                Sauté – Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.
                Cook beef – Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.
                Reduce wine – Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.
                Simmer – Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.
                Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)
                Taste and add more salt it desired. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.
                Tossing Sauce and Spaghetti (optional,)
                Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.
                Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.
                Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.
                Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</p1>

                ½ tablespoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
                
                1 ½ cups shredded Parmesan cheese (Optional)
                
                2 cups chopped broccoli (Optional)
                
                Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the centers and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook thin spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, add Alfredo sauce to the chicken along with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion, basil, salt, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne. Bring to a slight boil; stir in Parmesan cheese. Cook mixture until cheese is melted and you are able to lift a spoon out of the sauce without cheese hanging onto it, 3 to 5 minutes.

Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add broccoli, cover, and steam until tender, 2 to 6 minutes. Add broccoli to sauce.

Drain cooked pasta. Scoop into individual serving bowls and pour sauce on top.

                2 tablespoons vegetable oil
                
                ½ cup finely chopped onion
                
                ¾ cup ketchup
                
                2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
                
                2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauceMash brown sugar, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a mortar and pestle to form a paste. Spoon paste into a resealable plastic bag. Add chicken, coat with paste, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. For best results, marinate in the refrigerator at least 1 hour to overnight.

                When ready to cook, heat oil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in ketchup, vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until flavors blend, about 10 minutes.
                
                Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from the bag.
                
                Cook chicken on the preheated grill until brown, 3 to 5 minutes, turning once halfway through. Turn off one of the burners and move chicken over indirect heat. Maintain the temperature at 300 to 350 degrees F (150 to 175 degrees C).
                
                Cook chicken for 20 minutes, turning halfway through. Baste with sauce, then continue to cook, basting every 10 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 20 to 25 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

            <h3>Meatballs</h3>
            <p><b>Soft and flavorful meatballs in tomato sauce.</b></p>
            <p1>1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs ($0.32)
                1/2 cup grated Parmesan ($0.88)
                1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)
                1/2 tsp onion powder ($0.05)
                1/2 tsp Italian seasoning ($0.05)
                1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)
                1/4 tsp pepper ($0.03)
                2 large eggs ($0.42)
                1/4 cup whole milk ($0.11)
                1 lb. bulk Italian sausage ($3.00)
                1 lb. ground beef ($5.99) In a small bowl, combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. In a separate small bowl, lightly whisk the two eggs.
                Add the breadcrumb mixture, eggs, milk, Italian sausage, and ground beef to a large bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until evenly combined. Avoid over mixing the meat.
                Let the meatball mixture rest for five minutes to allow the breadcrumbs time to soften. Divide and shape the meat into about 32 meatballs, approximately 2 Tbsp in volume each.
                Oven Cooking Instructions
                Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the meatballs on the baking sheet about one inch apart from each other.
                Bake the meatballs for about 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.
                Transfer the meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for five more minutes in the sauce. If not using a red sauce, add an additional 3-5 minutes to the bake time, or until the meatballs are cooked through.
                Stove Top Cooking Instructions
                Add a tablespoon of cooking oil to a large skillet and heat over medium. Once hot, swirl the oil to coat the surface of the skillet. Add half of the meatballs to the skillet.
                Cook the meatballs, turning every couple of minutes, until browned on all sides and cooked through. Repeat with the second batch of meatballs.
                Transfer the cooked meatballs to a pot of red sauce and simmer for a few minutes more before serving.
                Freezing instructions
                You can freeze the meatballs either cooked or uncooked. I prefer freezing them already cooked so they can go straight from the freezer into a pot of red sauce and then just simmer until heated through. Cooked meatballs should be completely cooled before placing in a gallon-sized freezer bag and transferred to the freezer.
                To freeze uncooked meatballs, place the raw meatballs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze on the baking sheet until solid (1-2 hours) before transferring to a gallon-sized freezer bag for longer storage. Thaw completely before cooking.</p1>

                Next, prepare the chicken breasts. Pat the chicken breasts dry with a paper towel, then place them between sheets of plastic wrap and pound them thin, until they're approximately 1/2 inch in thickness. Then, season them with the kosher salt and black pepper.
                Next, crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk them to combine.
                In a separate bowl, add the panko bread crumbs, italian bread crumbs, and parmesan cheese, and mix to combine.
                Coat the chicken breasts by first dipping them into the bowl with the egg wash, and then dipping them into the bowl with the bread crumbs. Repeat until both of the chicken breasts are fully coated in the breadcrumbs.
                Then, transfer the coated chicken breasts to a baking sheet.
                Spray the tops of the chicken breasts with cooking spray, transfer them to the oven, and bake them for 15 minutes.
                While the chicken is baking, line a separate baking sheet with parchment paper and pour the marinara sauce on top.
                Then, top with the shredded mozzarella cheese.
                Place the tray into the oven with the chicken and bake it for 8-10 minutes. If you want the cheese to be browned, you can broil it for just 1 minute at the end, but watch it carefully so that it doesn't burn.
                Once the time is up, remove the trays from the oven.
                Transfer the chicken breasts to a plate, then pour the marinara and cheese mixture on top.
                Garnish with fresh parsley (if desired) then serve and enjoy!

            <h3>Sweet Potato Fries</h3>
            <p><b>Crispy fries made from sweet potatoes.</b></p>
            <p1>Preheat the oven to 450°F:
                For more crispiness, preheat your oven to 500°F.
                
                Place a roasting pan or heavy duty baking sheet (one that can take high heat) in the oven to preheat.
                
                Peel and cut the sweet potatoes into wedges:
                Peel the sweet potatoes and cut off the ends. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then, if they are very long, in half crosswise. Cut each piece into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick wedges. Alternately, you can slice the peeled sweet potato into disks either with a mandoline or a sharp knife.
                
                Toss with theoil, salt, spices:
Put the sweet potatoes into a large bowl and add the oil. Mix well to combine. Sprinkle with salt and spices of your choice. Use your hands to mix well, so all pieces are coated with oil and spices.Spread onto preheated pan:
Remove the preheated baking sheet from the oven. Carefully spread the sweet potatoes out in a single layer on the baking sheet. (Watch out, the pan is hot!)Bake:
Bake for 15 to 25 minutes. After the first 10 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn over all of the sweet potato pieces.

Return to the oven and bake for another 5 to 15 minutes, or until they are well browned.

Cooking time depends on the temperature of the oven (500°F will need less cooking time than 450°F) and the size and thinness of the sweet potato wedges.

The browner they are, the crispier they will be, but there is a fine line between browned and burnt beyond edibility. Even if they get really dark, they should still be good because of the natural sugars of the sweet potatoes caramelizing. So watch carefully.When ready let the fries cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p1>

            <h3>Lasagna</h3>
            <p><b>Classic lasagna with layers of pasta, cheese, and meat sauce.</b></p>
            <p1>15 oz. ricotta cheese, 2 cups
                ▢1 large egg
                ▢2 cups mozzarella cheese
                ▢¾ cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated
                ▢2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
                ▢½ teaspoon salt
                ▢¼ tsp pepper
                Meat Sauce
                ▢1 tablespoon olive oil
                ▢1 yellow onion, finely diced
                ▢¾ lb. ground beef
                ▢¾ lb. ground Italian sausage
                ▢3 cloves garlic, minced
                ▢½ cup chicken broth
                ▢40 oz. marinara sauce, see notes
                ▢1 tablespoon tomato paste
                ▢1 teaspoon hot sauce
                ▢1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
                Lasagna Noodles/ Cheese Topping
                ▢12 lasagna noodles, plus extra in case of breakage
                ▢2.5 cups mozzarella cheese 
                Prep Work
                Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.
                Make the Meat Sauce
                Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)
                Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.
                Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.
                Preheat Oven and Cook the Lasagna Noodles
                Preheat oven to 375°.
                Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool.
                Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.
                Assemble
                Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.
                Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.
                Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.
                Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.
                Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.
                Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.
                Bake
                Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.
                Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving to allow the layers to set.</p1>

                ▢Ketchup
                ▢Mustard
                On the side:
                ▢French fries (and it’s epic!)
                Cook Mode
                Prevent screen from sleeping
                Instructions
                
                Patties: Separate the beef into 4 equal portions, or 8 if making double cheeseburgers (do it!). Gently roll each portion into balls then press down into round patties that are slightly larger than your bun to allow for shrinkage (12 cm / 4.7" wide, 1 cm / 0.4" thick for a 10cm / 4" burger bun).
                Prepare: Get all your burger bits and pieces out and ready to use. Don't salt your beef until just before cooking (it toughens the meat).
                Toast buns: Preheat the grill to high. Place the bread cut face up on a tray and toast for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. (If using BBQ, place cut face down on the grill). Set aside.
                Dent patty: Sprinkle one side of patties with half the salt and pepper. Flip, then press a dent into the middle of each patty. (Prevents patties doming when cooking and reduces shrinkage!). Sprinkle this dented side with the remaining salt and pepper.
                Stove:
                Preheat 1 tablespoon oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very hot – smoking hot! (Note 6)
                Cook: Cook 2 to 4 patties (whatever fits in the pan) for 1 1/2 minutes. Press down lightly with a spatula (not too hard else the meat juices squeeze out!). Flip, then immediately top with a slice of cheese. Cook for another 1 1/2 minutes (cheese will melt by itself!) then transfer burgers to a tray to rest for 3 minutes.
                BBQ/Grilling:
                Preheat: If your BBQ hot plate/grill is well seasoned (ie oiled), there is no need to oil before cooking. If not, lightly brush with vegetable or canola oil (or use scrunched up paper towel). Then preheat your BBQ on high until very hot and you see wisps of smoke.
                Cook the burgers per above directions for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, topping with cheese as soon as you flip, then resting for 3 minutes. (You can also toast the buns on the grill (face down on the grills, 2 – 3 minutes.)
                Assemble:
                Slather the base of the bun with your sauce of choice. My order of assembly: lettuce, tomato, burger (x 2 for double!), gherkins, onion, sauce on bun lid, jam it on top of the stack.
                DEVOUR with French Fries on the side.

            <h3>Shakshuka</h3>
            <p><b>Poached eggs in a spiced tomato sauce.</b></p>
            <p1>▢2 tablespoons olive oil
                ▢1 medium onion, diced
                ▢1 red bell pepper, seeded and diced
                ▢4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
                ▢2 teaspoon paprika
                ▢1 teaspoon cumin
                ▢¼ teaspoon chili powder
                ▢1 (28-ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes
                ▢6 large eggs
                ▢salt and pepper, to taste
                ▢1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
                ▢1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped
                Instructions 
                Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent.
                Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.
                Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.
                
                Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and crack the eggs into each well. Cook the eggs for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking. You can also cover the pan with a lid to expedite the eggs cooking.
                Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley before serving.</p1>

                4 ounces tortilla chips, or as needed
                
                Toppings (optional):
                
                1/2 cup sour cream (optional)
                
                1/2 cup salsa (optional)

                For taco seasoning, stir paprika, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.
                
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in onion and green pepper; cook and stir with oil and juices from browned meat until much of the liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.
                
                Stir 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and Mexican-style corn into skillet. Season beef mixture to taste with prepared taco seasoning mix.
                
                Stir together the remaining 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until heated through, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 to 3 minutes.
                
                To assemble nachos, lay half of tortilla chips in a single layer on a microwave-safe plate, then drop teaspoons of refried beans onto chips, followed by meat mixture and shredded cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, beans, meat, and cheese to make a second layer.
                
                Microwave on High until cheese is melted and nachos are warm, 2 to 3 minutes. Top with sour cream, salsa, olives, jalapenos, and green onion as desired.

                ▢2 slices bacon diced
                Instructions 
                Prepare the Filling
                Vegetables
                Dice 1 cup of vegetables.
                Over medium-high heat, sauté the vegetables and garlic in olive oil until soft, about 3-5 minutes depending on the vegetables you choose. Set aside.
                Bacon/Sausage
                Cook bacon (or sausage), garlic and onion over medium heat until bacon is cooked and onion is soft (5-8 minutes). Set aside.
                Make the Omelette
                Whisk eggs vigorously until they are homogenous (uniform throughout). Whisk in salt and pepper.
                Melt butter in an 8” nonstick skillet over medium-low heat.
                Add whisked eggs and swirl the pan until they are evenly distributed.
                Cover the pan and cook over medium-low heat until the eggs begin to set. Once they begin to set, use a spatula to gently push the edges in slightly and swirl the pan so that any uncooked eggs on the top pour over the sides to the edges of the pan and cook.
                Once the omelette is mostly set (about 5-6 minutes), carefully flip it and turn off the heat.
                Sprinkle cheese over the top of the omelette.
                Then, add the toppings on one half of the omelette, and fold the other half over the toppings.
                Serve immediately.</p1>

            <h3>Pineapple Fried Rice</h3>
            <p><b>Stir-fried rice with sweet pineapple chunks.</b></p>
            <p1>2 tablespoons coconut oil or quality vegetable oil, divided
                2 eggs, beaten with a dash of salt
                1 ½ cups chopped fresh pineapple
                1 large red bell pepper, diced
                ¾ cup chopped green onions (about ½ bunch)
                2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
                ½ cup chopped raw, unsalted cashews
                
                2 cups cooked and chilled brown rice*, preferably long-grain brown jasmine rice
                1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce
                1 to 2 teaspoons chili garlic sauce or sriracha
                1 small lime, halved
                Salt, to taste
                Handful of fresh cilantro leaves, torn into little pieces, for garnishing
                Instructions
                
                Heat a large wok, cast iron skillet or non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat and place an empty serving bowl nearby. Once the pan is hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact, add 1 teaspoon oil. Pour in the eggs and cook, stirring frequently, until the eggs are scrambled and lightly set, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer the eggs to the empty bowl. Wipe out the pan if necessary with a paper towel (be careful, it’s hot!).
                Add 1 tablespoon oil to the pan and add the pineapple and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until the liquid has evaporated and the pineapple is caramelized on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes. Then add the green onion and garlic. Cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Transfer the contents of the pan to your bowl of eggs.
                Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil to the pan. Pour in the cashews and cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Add the rice to the pan and stir to combine. Cook until the rice is hot, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes.
                Pour the contents of the bowl back into the pan and stir to combine, breaking up the scrambled eggs with your spoon. Cook until the contents are warmed through, then remove the pan from heat. Add the tamari and chili garlic sauce, to taste. Squeeze the juice of ½ lime over the dish and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and set aside.
                Slice the remaining ½ lime into 4 wedges. Transfer the stir-fry to individual serving bowls and garnish each bowl with a lime wedge and a light sprinkle of cilantro. Serve with bottles of tamari and chili garlic sauce or sriracha on the side, for those who might want to add more to their bowls.</p1>

            <h3>Chicken Fajitas</h3>
            <p><b>Seasoned chicken strips served with peppers and tortillas.</b></p>
            <p1>1 tablespoon chili powder

                1 teaspoon ground cumin
                
                1 teaspoon ground paprika
                
                1 teaspoon salt

                ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
                
                ¼ teaspoon garlic powder
                
                1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast, cut into strips
                
                4 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed
                
                2 bell peppers, sliced
                
                1 onion, thinly sliced
                
                8 (6 inch) flour tortillas
                
                
                Directions
                Whisk chili powder, paprika, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder for fajita seasoning together in a small bowl.
                
                Trim chicken of any excess fat and place in a large, lidded bowl. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with about 3/4 of the fajita seasoning. Toss, adding more oil if necessary, until coated. Poke chicken with a knife to allow penetration of seasoning and oil. Place the lid on the bowl and shake until chicken is thoroughly coated. Marinate in the refrigerator, shaking every couple of hours, for 4 to 6 hours.
                
                Remove the marinating bowl from the refrigerator and let sit on the counter until chicken is room temperature, about 1 hour.
                
                Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make 2 stacks of 4 tortillas, and wrap each one in aluminum foil.
                
                Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add peppers and onion. Stir in remaining fajita seasoning and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes.
                
                While vegetables are cooking, place tortillas in the oven to warm. At the same time, grill chicken, turning halfway through, until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
                
                To assemble fajitas, fill warmed tortillas with chicken, peppers, and onions.</p1>

            <h3>Pizza Margherita</h3>
            <p><b>A simple pizza with fresh mozzarella and basil.</b></p>
            <p1>Ingredients
                Homemade Pizza Dough:
                2½ cups (300 g) unbleached all-purpose flour
                1 teaspoon granulated sugar
                ½ teaspoon active dry yeast or SAF instant yeast
                ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
                7 ounces (105°F to 115°F) warm water
                1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
                semolina and all-purpose flour for dusting the pizza peel
                Pizza Sauce:
                1 cup pureed or crushed canned San Marzano tomatoes (or canned Italian plum tomatoes)
                2-3 fresh garlic cloves grated with a microplane or pressed
                1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling
                2-3 large pinches of kosher salt to taste
                ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
                Toppings:
                2-3 tablespoons finely grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese plus more for serving
                7 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese (not packed in water) cut into ½-inch cubes
                5-6 large fresh basil leaves plus more for garnishing
                dried red pepper flakes optional
                Instructions 
                Prepare Pizza Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, sugar, yeast and salt. Add the warm water and olive oil, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until the dough just begins to come together. It will seem shaggy and dry, but don’t worry.
                Scrape the dough onto a well-floured counter top and knead the dough for three minutes. It should quickly come together and begin to get sticky. Dust the dough with flour as needed (sometimes I will have to do this 2 to 3 times, depending on humidity levels) – it should be slightly tacky, but should not be sticking to your counter top.  After about 3 minutes, the dough should be smooth, slightly elastic, and tacky. Lightly grease a large mixing bowl with olive oil, and place the dough into the bowl.
                Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel (or plastic wrap) and allow the dough to rise in a warm, dry area of your kitchen for 2 hours or until the dough has doubled in size. Proofing Tip: If your kitchen is very cold, heat a large heatproof measuring cup of water in the microwave for 2 to 3 minutes. This creates a nice warm environment. Remove the cup and place the bowl with the dough in the microwave until it has risen. [If you are preparing the dough in advance, see the note section for freezing instructions.]
                Preheat Oven and Pizza Steel or Stone: Place the pizza steel (or stone) on the second to top rack of your oven (roughly 8 inches from the broiler element), and preheat the oven and steel (or stone) to 550°F (285°C) for a minumum of 1 hour. If your oven does not go up to 550°F (285°C) or you are using a delicate pizza stone, I recommend heating it to a maximum of 500°F (260°C)
                As the oven is preheating, assemble the ingredients. In a small bowl, stir together the pureed tomatoes, minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pepper, and salt. Set aside another small bowl with the cubed mozzarella cheese (pat the cheese with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture). Set aside the basil leaves and grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese for easy grabbing.
                Separate the dough into two equal-sized portions. It will deflate slightly, but that is OK. Place the dough on a large plate or floured counter top, cover gently with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
                Assemble the Pizza: Sprinkle the pizza peel (if you do not own a pizza peel, you can try using the back of a half sheet pan - but it is tricky!) with a tablespoon of semolina and dusting of all-purpose flour. Gently use both hands to stretch one ball of pizza dough into roughly a 10-inch circle (don’t worry if its not perfectly uniform). If the dough springs back or is too elastic, allow it to rest for an additional five minutes. The edges of the dough can be slightly thicker, but make sure the center of the dough is thin (you should be able to see some light through it if you held it up). Gently transfer the dough onto the semolina and flour dusted pizza peel or baking sheet.
                Drizzle or brush the dough lightly (using your fingertips) with olive oil (roughly a teaspoon. Using a large spoon, add roughly ½ cup of the tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, leaving a ½-inch or ¾-inch border on all sides. Use the back of the spoon to spread it evenly and thinly. Sprinkle a tablespoon of parmigiano-reggiano cheese onto the pizza sauce. Add half of the cubed mozzarella, distributing it evenly over the entire pizza. Using your hands, tear a few large basil leaves, and sprinkle the basil over the pizza. At this point, I’ll occasionally stretch the sides of the dough out a bit to make it even thinner. Gently slide the pizza from the peel onto the heated baking stone. Bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and caramelized and the edges of the pizza are golden brown. Note: If you're looking for more color, finish the pizza under the low or medium broil setting, but watch it carefully!
                Remove the pizza carefully from the oven with the pizza peel, transfer to a wooden cutting board or foil, drizzle the top with olive oil, some grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese, and chiffonade of fresh basil. Slice and serve immediately and/or prepare the second pizza.</p1>

            <h3>Beef Burritos</h3>
            <p><b>Flavorful beef wrapped in a soft tortilla.</b></p>
            <p1>Burrito Seasoning:
                ▢1 tsp each onion powder , dried oregano, salt
                ▢2 tsp each dried cumin powder , paprika
                ▢1/4 tsp black pepper
                ▢¼ tsp cayenne pepper , or to taste (optional)
                Beef:
                ▢1/2 tbsp olive oil
                ▢2 garlic cloves
                ▢½ onion , finely chopped
                ▢500g / 1 lb beef mince (ground beef), I use lean
                ▢2 tbsp tomato paste
                ▢3 tbsp water
                Burritos:
                ▢6 - 8 large soft flour tortillas or round wraps (~25cm/10”+) (Note 1)
                ▢3 cups cooked rice , warm not piping hot (I use white long grain)
                ▢3 cups iceberg lettuce or cabbage , finely sliced (use cabbage if freezing)
                ▢1 cup corn kernels (I use canned, drained)
                ▢1 cup black beans (I use canned, drained)
                ▢3 tomatoes, deseeded and diced
                ▢1/2 red onion , finely chopped
                ▢Finely chopped coriander / cilantro (optional)
                ▢1 1/2 cups / 150g shredded cheese of choice (melting kind) 
                Heat oil in a skillet over high heat. Add garlic and onion, cook for 2 minutes until onion is lightly browned. Add beef and cook, breaking it up as you go, until it turns from red to brown.
                Add Taco Seasoning (or use 1 packet store bought) and cook for 1 minute. Then add tomato paste and water, cook for 3 minutes until the water is mostly evaporated but the beef is still juicy, not dried out. Set aside to cool for 10 minutes – piping hot filling will steam the burrito, making the tortilla soggy.
                Optional: If not warming rolled burrito, warm the tortillas before rolling (per packet directions).
                Place a burrito on a work surface. Place 1/4 - 1/3 cup of rice just below the centre. Top with 1/4 - 1/3 cup beef, then some lettuce, corn, black beans, tomato,  a sprinkle of red onion, coriander and cheese.
                Fold up the bottom to cover the filling then fold the edges in (video helpful to see how to do this). Roll up tightly, then wrap in foil. Serve as is or heat per below.
                HEATING: To warm through, pan fry (dry pan) in the foil over medium high heat for a few minutes on each side to slightly crisp and warm the outside. Or for 10+ minutes on a medium low heat if you want to melt the cheese. Or they can be baked at 180C/350F for 20 minutes in the foil – this will warm them all the way through and crisp up the tortilla slightly. If they are straight from the fridge, they will take around 30 minutes to warm through.
                Burritos are best served with something to dollop/dip - sour cream (or yoghurt) and some sort of chilli sauce are my usual because it's easy. When I'm making more of an effort, I use  Restaurant Style Salsa or Guacamole.</p1>

            <h3>Fish and Chips</h3>
            <p><b>Crispy battered fish served with fries.</b></p>
            <p1>1 ½ lbs white fish fillets* , cut into long strips
                ▢1 cup all-purpose flour , plus more for dredging fish
                ▢1/2 cup cornstarch
                ▢1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
                ▢¼ teaspoon paprika
                ▢½ teaspoon salt , plus more for seasoning fish
                ▢¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper , plus more for seasoning fish
                ▢1 cup cold light beer*
                For Serving:
                ▢Hot cooked Fries (fried, baked, or air fryer)
                ▢Tartar Sauce , ketchup, or fry sauce
                ▢British Malt Vinegar 
                Heat Oil: Add oil to a deep pot—about 1-2 inches full–and heat oil to 350 degrees F. The oil temperature is key to success: Make sure the oil is at the right temperature. Use a thermometer to monitor the oil temp (at least 350 and no higher than 375). If the oil is too hot, the fish wont cook fast enough before the coating is overly crisp. If the oil is not hot enough, the coating will be soggy/soft instead of crisp. Also, don’t overcrowd the pot, which can lower the oil temp, and keep the coating from crisping.
                Prepare Fish: Depending on the size and shape of your fillets, cut them into strips that are long and at least 1 inch wide. Lay the fish fillets on a paper towel and pat dry. Season them generously with sea salt and pepper and then dredge each filet in a little bit of flour.
                Make Batter: In a large bowl, mix the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Whisk in the beer (or club soda) to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a slightly thick, smooth batter. If it’s too thick, add a little more beer.
                Batter and Fry: Check oil temperature to make sure it’s about 350 degrees F. Dip prepared fillets into the batter and use a spoon if needed to help coat the entire fillet. Working in small batches so you don’t overcrowd the pans, carefully lower a few dipped fillets at a time into the hot oil. Fry for approximately 5-7 minutes, turning occasionally, until the batter is crisp and golden and the fish is perfectly cooked. I like to cook just one at the beginning to get an estimated cook time, before cooking more. You don’t want to overcook the fish! Keep in mind the fish will continue to cook a little more as it cools off on the paper towel.
                (If you have any leftover batter, you could also dip and fry onion rings, calamari, or shrimp!)
                
                Rest: Once cooked, remove the fillets from the hot oil and drain on paper towels. You can keep the cooked fish warm in a 200 degree oven while you cook it all, if you want.
                Serve: Use the same pot of hot oil to make French Fries, or make my Baked French Fries or Air Fryer French Fries. Serve with homemade tartar sauce (it can be made days ahead of time!) and malt vinegar, for dipping.</p1>

            <h3>Chicken Pot Pie</h3>
            <p><b>Comforting chicken and vegetable stew in a flaky pie crust.</b></p>
            <p1>Homemade Pie Crust or All Butter Pie Crust (both recipes make 2 crusts, 1 for bottom and 1 for top)
                1 pound (450g) skinless boneless chicken breast or thighs, cubed
                1 cup (about 130g) sliced carrots (about 2 carrots)
                1/2 cup (about 40g) sliced celery
                1/3 cup (5 Tbsp; 71g) unsalted butter
                1/3 cup (45g) chopped yellow onion (1/2 of a small onion)
                1 teaspoon minced garlic
                1/3 cup (41g) all-purpose flour
                3/4 teaspoon salt
                1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
                1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
                1 and 3/4 cups (420ml) chicken broth/stock (I recommend reduced sodium)
                2/3 cup (160ml) half-and-half*
                1 cup (125g) frozen peas
                egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 Tablespoon (15ml) milk
                optional: sprigs of fresh thyme for garnish 
                The crust: Prepare either pie crust recipe through step 5, including chilling for at least 2 hours. I usually make the crust the night before. The pie crust recipe makes 2 crusts and you’ll be using both crusts.
                In a large pot, combine chicken, carrots, and celery. Add enough water to cover the chicken and vegetables, then place over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then allow to boil for 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain, and set aside.
                In a large skillet over medium heat, combine the butter, onions, and garlic. Stirring occasionally, cook until the onions are translucent and the butter is lightly browning. Whisk in the flour, salt, black pepper, thyme, chicken broth, and half-and-half. Cook and whisk until no flour lumps remain, then simmer over medium-low heat until thick. I simmer mine for 10 minutes. You want it to be a very thick gravy; simmer longer if necessary. Taste and add more seasonings if you prefer. Sometimes I add more thyme. Remove from heat and set aside.
                
                Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
                After the pie dough has chilled: On a floured work surface, roll out one of the discs of chilled dough (keep the other one in the refrigerator). Turn the dough about a quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle about 12 inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch pie dish that’s 1.5–2 inches deep. Tuck the dough in with your fingers, making sure it is smooth. With a small sharp knife or kitchen shears, trim the extra overhang of dough and discard.
                Spoon the chicken and vegetable mixture into the crust. Scatter the frozen peas on top. Pour/spread the gravy evenly over top.
                Roll out second half of pie crust dough just as you did the first. Cover the pie with the second crust and trim the extra overhang off the sides. Crimp the pie crust with a fork to seal the edges. With a small sharp knife, slice a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. Using a pastry brush, brush crust and edges with egg wash.
                Bake for 32–38 minutes or until the top of the crust is golden brown. After 20 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown. (See this post on the best pie baking tools for instructions on how to make a pie crust shield out of foil.)
                Remove from the oven and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. Makes amazing leftovers—the filling is so thick on the next day! Reheat as desired. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</p1>

            <h3>Grilled Shrimp</h3>
            <p><b>Grilled shrimp with a zesty marinade.</b></p>
            <p1>2 tablespoons olive oil
                2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
                3 large garlic cloves finely minced
                2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning
                1 teaspoon granulated sugar
                ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
                ¼ teaspoon kosher salt
                ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
                1 pound jumbo I use 21-25 count raw shrimp, tails on and deveined
                Instructions
                Heat grill to medium-high/high. Clean grates and then rub oil on grates.
                In a low, wide medium-sized bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, garlic, Old Bay, sugar, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.
                Add the shrimp to the bowl and fold gently to coat the shrimp evenly in the seasoned oil.
                Place shrimp on the hot grill grates and cook for 3 minutes, or until they have some char. Flip shrimp and cook for another 2 minutes, or just until shrimp are no longer translucent. Take care to not overcook. Smaller shrimp will take less time. 
                Serve immediately for best texture and flavor, with fresh lemon wedges for squeezing over the top.</p1>

            <h3>Chicken Tenders</h3>
            <p><b>Crispy breaded chicken tenders with dipping sauces.</b></p>
            <p1>1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs (Note 1)
                ▢Oil spray
                Batter
                ▢1 egg
                ▢1 tbsp mayonnaise
                ▢1 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard (or other mustard)
                ▢2 tbsp flour
                ▢1/2 tsp salt
                ▢Black pepper
                Chicken
                ▢500 g/1 lb chicken tenderloins (or breast cut into 2/3″ / 1.5cm thick slices, lengthwise)
                ▢Oil spray 
                Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
                Spread panko on a baking tray, spray with oil (spray vertically to avoid blowing the panko off the tray), then bake for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. Transfer to bowl.
                Place a rack on a baking tray (not critical but bakes more evenly).
                Place the Batter ingredients in a bowl and whisk with a fork until combined.
                Add the chicken into the Batter and toss to coat.
                Crumbing 
                Pick up chicken with tongs and place it into the panko bowl.
                Sprinkle surface with breadcrumbs, then press down to adhere. Transfer onto baking tray. Marvel at clean fingers, repeat with remaining chicken.
                Spray lightly with oil, sprinkle with a touch of salt (optional). Bake 15 minutes (medium) or up to 20 minutes if gigantic. Any longer = dried out chicken.
                Remove from oven and serve immediately, with Sauce of choice (Honey Mustard) and sprinkled with fresh parsley, if desired.</p1>

            <h3>Chocolate Cake</h3>
            <p><b>Rich and moist chocolate cake with frosting.</b></p>
            <p1>CHOCOLATE CAKE
                ▢1 ¾ cups all purpose flour or plain flour
                
                ▢¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder or regular Hershey's cocoa powder
                ▢1 ½ teaspoon baking powder
                ▢1 ½ teaspoon baking soda or bi-carb soda
                ▢1 teaspoon salt
                ▢2 cups white granulated sugar
                ▢2 large eggs
                ▢1 cup milk
                ▢½ cup vegetable oil
                ▢2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
                ▢1 cup boiling water
                CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING
                ▢4 oz butter
                ▢⅔ cup unsweetened cocoa powder or regular HERSHEY'S (2.4 oz | 65 g)
                
                ▢3 cups powdered sugar confectioners or icing sugar
                ▢⅓ cup milk
                ▢1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 
                Instructions
                CHOCOLATE CAKE
                Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C) standard or 320°F (160°C) fan/convection.
                Lightly grease 2x 9-inch (22cm) round cake pans with butter. Line base with parchment paper.
                Sift together flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large bowl. Whisk in sugar, then add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla. Whisk well to combine until lump free, about 30 seconds.
                
                Pour boiling water into batter, mixing well. Cake batter is thin in consistency.
                Pour batter into cake pans and bake for 30-35 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.
                Let cool for 10 minutes, then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely before frosting.
                CHOCOLATE BUTTERCREAM FROSTING
                Melt butter, then whisk in cocoa powder. Alternately add powdered sugar and milk, beating to spreading consistency (add a small amount of additional milk, if needed). Stir in vanilla.</p1>

            <h3>Steak Frites</h3>
            <p><b>Grilled steak served with crispy French fries.</b></p>
            <p1>Ingredients 
                1x
                2x
                3x
                
                ▢2 to 3 russet potatoes, scrubbed, and sliced into desired fries shape
                ▢peanut oil for frying, vegetable or canola work too
                ▢kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
                ▢parsley, extra virgin olive oil, and parmesan to toss with fries, optional
                ▢1 pound steaks of choice (we are using a bavette cut), ribeye steak, bavette, hanger steak, sirloin, new york strip, etc.
                ▢1 tablespoon avocado oil or high smoke point oil to sear steak
                ▢2 tablespoons unsalted butter
                ▢2 large garlic cloves
                ▢2 rosemary sprigs
                ▢Horseradish Cream Sauce, for serving
                Instructions 
                
                Prep and make your fries. Scrub and wash your potatoes and slice them into your desired shapes, I like mine in between a shoestring and smaller than a wedge.
                Place your cut potatoes in a bowl with ice water. This helps gets out the starch and helps get it crispy. Soak for about 30 minutes and up to 2 hours.
                Place your potatoes on paper towels and pat dry completely. Heat a deep-fryer, or a deep cast iron and fill it with peanut oil or vegetable oil (any neutral oil will do) to about 300°F, about 5-6 minutes. While it’s heating up, line a baking sheet with paper towels.
                First fry. Add in your fries with a slotted spoon in batches for your first fry into the hot oil. You don't wan't color on the fries, just for them to be tender inside, about 10 minutes. Then transfer to your baking sheet and transfer to the refrigerator for 30 minutes and up to 1 hour.
                
                At this point, take out your steaks to room temperature. Season with salt and pepper. *TIP: I find the fries really get crispy this way, but you can eliminate both the wait time for soaking, and wait for in the fridge after the first fry if you prefer, it will still be delicious. 🙂
                Second fry. When it's time for your second fry, heat up that same oil to about 400°F, and take your cold fries (from the fridge) and this time you are going to brown them and make them super crispy, in batches being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Once your desired crispness, place on new paper towels on the parchment sheet to shake off any excess oil.
                Transfer to a mixing bowl and toss with salt, pepper, a drizzle of olive oil, chopped parsley and parmesan, toss and set to the side.
                Sear steak. Now, it's time to make our steak. Take your steak and heat a cast iron skillet until piping hot. Add in your steaks and sear on medium high heat for about 4-5 minutes to get a nice char. This will vary depending on your size of steak, though. Then flip.
                
                Once flipped, add in your butter, rosemary and garlic cloves. Baste your steak until fully cooked to your liking (I like medium rare which is around 135°F). Let rest for about 10-13 minutes and slice against the grain.
                Serve! Transfer your sliced steak to a plate and finish off with your french fries and Horseradish Cream Sauce.</p1>

            <h3>Eggplant Stir Fry</h3>
            <p><b>A savory stir fry with eggplant and other vegetables.</b></p>
            <p1>Ingredients

                2 large Chinese long eggplant (can also use regular eggplant)
                1 teaspoon salt
                1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cornstarch
                2½ tablespoon soy sauce or tamari
                1 tablespoon sugar (I like coconut sugar)
                2½ tablespoon oil suitable for high heat cooking
                3 cloves garlic, crushed
                1 teaspoon ginger, minced
                To serve
                Green onions/ spring onions
                Sesame seeds
                Instructions
                Cut eggplants into 4 pieces lengthwise, then cut each piece into rough 2-inch strips.
                (NOTE: The two next steps are optional and will give you crispier eggplant. If short on time, skip straight to step 4 and fry eggplant without soaking/coating.)
                Stir 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl of water, and submerge eggplant pieces (cover with a plate to ensure pieces are submerged). Leave to soak for 15 minutes.
                
                Drain and pat dry eggplant with paper towel, then toss in 1 tablespoon cornstarch, ensuring eggplant is evenly coated.
                In a small bowl, mix together soy sauce, sugar and remaining 1 teaspoon cornstarch until combined (use a whisk to break down cornstarch lumps).
                Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet or frying pan on medium high heat. Add eggplant in a single layer and fry until golden - 6-8 minutes - flipping frequently. (If skillet isn't large enough, do two batches.)
                Transfer eggplant to a plate. Add remaining ½ tablespoon oil to skillet. Sauté garlic and ginger for 30 seconds on medium heat.
                Add sauce and cooked eggplant to skillet, and cook - stirring - for one minute to allow sauce to thicken.
                Decorate with green onion slices and sesame seeds, and serve with rice or noodles if desired.
